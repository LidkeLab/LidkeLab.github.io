# Overview

Our research involves developing and using optical techniques, specifically fluorescence microscopy, for the study of the distribution, dynamics and interactions of cellular components. Cells scatter or absorb very little light in the visible range. Due to this transparency, fluorescence microscopy, a method where only the component of interest is tagged with a fluorophore, is one of the best techniques currently available to study the distribution and dynamics of cellular components in living or intact cells.

However, the direct observation of static or dynamic interactions between cellular components has been elusive due to the fact that the resolution of the light microscope is ~ 250 nm, whereas interactions typically occur at the ~ 10 nm scale. The primary goal of the K.A Lidke lab is to develop new optical techniques that are able to probe cellular structure and dynamics at or close to the molecular scale and to apply these techniques to specific biological and biophysical questions.

## Research Focus Areas

### Single-Molecule Localization-based Superresolution
Fluorophores distributed with inter-particle spacing less than 250 nm become difficult to resolve due to diffraction and the overlap of their observed intensity patterns. In Single-Molecule Localization-based Superresolution (SML-SR), one of many possible methods is used to identify and localize single molecules in a densely labeled sample. If the localization precision is better than the diffraction limit and the density of fluorophores is sufficiently high, a super-resolution image can be constructed from the fluorophore positions.

### Multi-Color Single Particle Tracking using Hyperspectral Microscopy
Spectral differences in fluorescence probes allow precise localization of multiple proteins separated at distances much less than the diffraction limit. Using the spectral dimension for separation leaves the time dimension available for tracking dynamics in living cells. The K.A. Lidke lab has developed a high-speed hyperspectral microscope capable of tracking up to eight spectral species of fluorescent quantum dots probes with frame rates up to 30 Hz.

### Image and Data Analysis
Modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have approximately two orders of magnitude higher floating point performance than that of CPUs. The K.A. Lidke lab has developed efficient routines for the estimation of fluorophore positions that run on GPU architecture using NVIDIA's CUDA interface. Our implementations achieve over 10‚Å∂ fits per second, making the most demanding computational task of superresolution analysis trivial.
