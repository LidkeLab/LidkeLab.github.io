### Overview
This course covers topics related to simulation, analysis and interpretation of biophysical processes and related microscopy imaging techniques.  

This course will use an unconventional format that involves collaboratively developing a next-generation LLM-based image/data analysis platform that combines the Julia programming language, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It will require students to gain proficiency with Git/GitHub and state-of-the-art agentic coding tools such as claude-code.         

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Implement and apply computational methods for analyzing biophysical data and microscopy images
- Design and execute simulations of biophysical processes including diffusion, molecular interactions, and fluorophore photophysics.
- Apply estimation theory and statistical methods to extract quantitative information from noisy microscopy data
- Develop scientific software collaboratively using modern version control and development practices
- Integrate Large Language Models and AI tools effectively into scientific computing workflows
- Evaluate and apply appropriate image processing techniques for biological microscopy data
- Critically assess the limitations and assumptions of different computational approaches in biophysics

The concepts will include: 

#### Topics 
**Simulation of Biophysical Processes and Microscopy Systems**
- Monte Carlo Markov Chains and fluorophore photophysics 
- Diffusion and interaction of membrane proteins
- Polymer models including worm-like chains
- Microscope Point Spread Function calculations and engineering
- Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data
- Detectors and noise models
**Image and Data Analysis Techniques**
- Estimation theory, Fisher Information and Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds
- Bayesian Methods
- Basic image and data processing 
- Analysis of single molecule localization microscopy data 
- Analysis of single particle tracking data
- Deconvolution techniques including Wiener filtering, Richardson-Lucy and Neural Networks
- Image stitching and registration
- Basic concepts of training and using Neural Networks for image analysis
   
Other topics may be covered based on student interest.  


#### Format 
The lectures will introduce the concepts and theory behind each topic.  

The class will then collectively generate and test implementations of the analysis and simulations tools.  These will be plugged into a next-generation LLM-based data/image analysis concept that is in development by the Lidke lab and will be available for use by the UNM community.

To build these tools, students will learn: 

- Working knowledge of the Julia programming language
- Git/GitHub for software versioning and collaborative development
- How, when and when not to use state-of-the-art agentic coding tools such as claude-code
- How to build and use Model Context Protocol servers
- Context engineering for LLMs

### Prerequisites 

There are no formal prerequisites, but knowldedge of the following concepts will be assumed and used throughout the class:

- Programming fundamentals (language agnostic): functions, loops, conditionals, inheritance.   
- Calculus and differential equations
- Linear Algebra
- Basic statistics (mean, variance, probability distributions)
- Basic optics   
- Fourier Transforms
 

### Grading
The course can be taken for a letter grade or C/NC.  

Students will be evaluated based on their contributions to our collaborative development effort. Evaluation will be based on a combination of instructor review, peer review, and an LLM review of contributions to the code base.  

Evaluations and grade assessments will be conducted at 1/3, 2/3, and the end of the course, with the final evaluation determining course grades.  

Requirements for each grade:

**A** - Has led the successful development of at least two larger analysis or simulation tools (scope to be negotiated with instructor). Has provided useful feedback to other projects continuously throughout the course.

**B** - Has led the successful development of at least one large and one small analysis or simulation tool (scope to be negotiated with instructor). Has provided useful feedback to other projects continuously throughout the course.

**C/Credit** - Has led the successful development of at least one small analysis or simulation tool (scope to be negotiated with instructor). Has provided useful feedback to other projects continuously throughout the course.
