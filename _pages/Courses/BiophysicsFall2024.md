# UNM Physics 480/581: Biological Physics

### Instructor: Prof. Keith Lidke

Room 2218 PAIS  
e-mail: klidke@unm.edu

### Lab and Office Hours

Monday and Wednesday at 15:30-16:45 in PAIS 1140, 2409
The logistics and scheduling of lab experiments will depend on the number of students and the modules under study.

---

### Overview

This course is designed to provide a flexible biophysics curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students from a range of majors and degree programs including Physics and Astronomy, Optics, Engineering and Biomedical Science. This is not a lecture-based course, it is instead organized around a selection of guided study modules that cover a wide range of topics in biophysics, microscopy and spectroscopy. Many modules have a significant laboratory component. The course can be taken for 1 to 3 credits where each credit requires three modules (9 modules required for 3 credits). The class may be taken twice for up to a total of 6 credits.

There is no required text for the class. Many reference resources will be listed or linked in each module.

---

### Grading

Letter grades correspond with numerical scores as given by this scale: [Grade Scale](grading.html). Grades will be assigned based on the following:

#### Homework and Lab (70%)

Homework assignments and lab experiments will be specific to each module.

#### Module Exams (30%)

Each module has a corresponding final exam. Exam proctoring will be offered once per week a time and place TBD.
