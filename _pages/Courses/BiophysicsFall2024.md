# 581 Biophysics Fall 2024

# UNM Physics 480/581: Biological Physics

![PandA Home](images/panda_header.gif)

### Instructor: Prof. Keith Lidke

Room 2218 PAIS  
e-mail: klidke@unm.edu

### Lab and Office Hours

Tentatively: Monday and Wednesday at 16:00-17:30 in PAIS 1160,2015,2409
The logistics and scheduling of lab experiments will depend on the number of students and the modules under study.

### Overview

This course is designed to provide a flexible biophysics curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students from a range of majors and degree programs including Physics and Astronomy, Optics, Engineering and Biomedical Science. This is not a lecture based course, it is instead organized around a selection of guided study modules that cover a wide range of topics in biophysics, microscopy and spectroscopy. Many modules have a significant laboratory component. The course can be taken for 1 to 3 credits where each credit requires three modules (9 modules required for 3 credits). The class may be taken twice for up to a total of 6 credits.

There is no required text for the class. Many reference resources will be listed or linked in each module.

---

### Grading

Letter grades correspond with numerical scores as given by this scale: [Grade Scale](grading.html). Grades will be assigned based on the following:

#### Homework and Lab (70%)

Homework assignments and lab experiments will be specific to each module.

#### Module Exams (30%)

Each module has a corresponding final exam. Exam proctoring will be offered once per week a time and place TBD.

### General Reference Material

#### Installing MATLAB

1. Create an account at mathworks.com using your UNM email address.
2. Download and install the latest version of MATLAB (e.g. R2020a). We will not need or use most toolboxes. If you want to save download time and disk space, just install MATLAB and these toolboxes:
   - Statistics
   - Symbolic Math Toolbox
   - Image Processing Toolbox
   - Optimization Toolbox
   - Parallel Computing Toolbox
   - Signal Processing Toolbox
3. Follow instructions for validating your access with your UNM account.
